# AI Matching & Hiring Flow Overview (v2)

This document outlines the refined AI matching logic and the direct hiring process on WorkWise.

## 1. Groq Model Strategy & Failover

To ensure maximum reliability and performance using only the Groq API, we implement a **Multi-Model Priority Failover** architecture.

### Top 5 Recommended Models
1. **llama-3.3-70b-versatile**: Primary model for complex, high-accuracy matching.
2. **meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct**: Secondary model for specialized reasoning.
3. **meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct**: Third-tier fallback for instructions.
4. **qwen/qwen3-32b**: Fourth-tier alternative if Llama models are saturated.
5. **llama-3.1-8b-instant**: Final "instant" fallback for speed and high rate limits.

### Failover Architecture
- **Automatic Retry**: If the primary model returns a 429 (Rate Limit) or 503 (Overloaded), the `AIService` automatically attempts the request using the next model in the priority list.
- **Latency Optimization**: For non-critical insights, the system may default to the "Instant" model to preserve tokens/limits for high-priority matching.

## 2. Gig Worker Profile Completeness

A gig worker must complete the following to be eligible for high-tier AI matching:
- **Identity**: Valid ID Verification (`verified` status).
- **Professionalism**: Professional Title, Bio (min 50 chars), and Profile Picture.
- **Skills**: Minimum of 3 Skills with defined Experience Levels (`beginner`, `intermediate`, `expert`).
- **Services**: Minimum of 2 Specific Services from the taxonomy.
- **Logistics**: Hourly Rate (min ₱5/hr), Timezone, Working Hours, and Street Address.
- **Trust**: Verified Email and Ratings from previous jobs.

## 3. Employer Matching & Direct Hire Flow

Employers can find and hire talent through two primary paths:

### Path A: AI Recommendation (Proactive)
1. Employer navigates to **My Jobs**.
2. Employer clicks the **AI Match** button on a specific job card.
3. The system scans the worker pool based on skills, experience, and **historical ratings**.
4. Employer views a ranked list of candidates with **Success Prediction %**.

### Path B: Direct Hire (Reactive)
1. Employer visits a gig worker's profile.
2. Employer clicks the **Hire Me** button.
3. **In-App Chat**: An automated message is sent to the worker containing a link to the employer's posted job.
4. **Negotiation**: Worker replies in chat. They can skip the bidding stage and propose a price directly in conversation.
5. **Contract Setup**: Once agreed, the employer can modify the job's price to match the deal and create a **Contract**.
6. **Notification**: Gig worker receives a platform notification to sign the contract.

## 4. Enhanced Matching Process
- **Employer Side**: Matches workers based on skills, experience, and ratings.
- **Worker Side**: Recommends jobs based on the worker's skills, experience, and historical project success (ratings).
