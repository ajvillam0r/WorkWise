# ‚úÖ Mixed Content Error - FIXED!

## üéâ What Was Fixed

The mixed content error occurred because your app was loading over HTTPS but trying to load assets (CSS, JS) over HTTP.

### Changes Made:

### 1. **Force HTTPS in Production** (`AppServiceProvider.php`)
Added code to force all URLs to use HTTPS when in production environment:

```php
public function boot(): void
{
    // Force HTTPS in production
    if ($this->app->environment('production')) {
        URL::forceScheme('https');
    }
    
    Vite::prefetch(concurrency: 3);
}
```

### 2. **Created TrustProxies Middleware**
Created `app/Http/Middleware/TrustProxies.php` to handle Railway's proxy headers properly.

This middleware tells Laravel to trust Railway's proxy and detect HTTPS connections correctly.

### 3. **Registered TrustProxies Middleware**
Added the middleware to `bootstrap/app.php` at the beginning of the middleware stack.

## üîç One More Thing to Verify

**Check your Railway APP_URL variable:**

In Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Variables, make sure:

```env
# ‚úÖ CORRECT (no quotes, with https://)
APP_URL=https://workwise-production.up.railway.app

# ‚ùå WRONG (has quotes or http://)
APP_URL="https://workwise-production.up.railway.app"  # Remove quotes!
APP_URL=http://workwise-production.up.railway.app     # Should be https!
```

**To check the current value:**
```bash
railway run php artisan tinker --execute="echo env('APP_URL') . PHP_EOL;"
```

**If it still has quotes or http://, update it in Railway:**
1. Go to Railway Dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Go to Variables tab
4. Change `APP_URL` to: `https://workwise-production.up.railway.app` (no quotes!)
5. Railway will auto-redeploy

## ‚úÖ Testing the Fix

After Railway finishes deploying (should take 2-3 minutes):

1. **Clear your browser cache** (important!)
   - Chrome: `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
   - Or open an Incognito window

2. **Visit your site:**
   - https://workwise-production.up.railway.app

3. **Check the browser console (F12)**
   - You should NO LONGER see the mixed content errors
   - All assets should load over HTTPS

---

## üéØ What These Changes Do

### URL::forceScheme('https')
- Forces all generated URLs to use `https://` instead of `http://`
- Applies to asset URLs, route URLs, and all other URLs Laravel generates

### TrustProxies Middleware
- Tells Laravel to trust Railway's proxy headers
- Detects that the connection is HTTPS even though Railway's proxy forwards requests
- Reads headers like `X-Forwarded-Proto` to determine the actual protocol

---

## üîç Verify It's Working

Run this to see if Laravel detects HTTPS properly:
```bash
railway run php artisan about
```

Look for:
```
URL ................ https://workwise-production.up.railway.app  ‚Üê Should be https://
```

## üÜò If Still Seeing Mixed Content Errors

1. **Hard refresh your browser:**
   - Windows: `Ctrl + F5`
   - Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`

2. **Check APP_URL in Railway:**
   ```bash
   railway run php artisan tinker --execute="echo 'APP_URL: ' . config('app.url') . PHP_EOL;"
   ```
   
   Should output: `APP_URL: https://workwise-production.up.railway.app`

3. **Clear config cache on Railway:**
   ```bash
   railway run php artisan config:clear
   railway run php artisan config:cache
   ```

4. **Check browser console** for the exact URLs being loaded:
   - Should all start with `https://`
   - If any start with `http://`, the APP_URL is still wrong

---

## üìù Summary

- ‚úÖ **Forced HTTPS** in production environment
- ‚úÖ **Added TrustProxies** middleware for Railway
- ‚úÖ **Pushed changes** to GitHub
- ‚úÖ **Railway deployed** automatically

**Next:** Clear your browser cache and test the site!

The mixed content errors should be gone now. üéâ
